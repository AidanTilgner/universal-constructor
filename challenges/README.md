# Challenges Directory

This directory contains a series of challenges for the Universal Constructor project. Each challenge is designed to test and simulate various features and capabilities of the construction system.

## Format

-   Challenges are separated into directories numbered sequentially (e.g., `00_template`, `01_hello_world`).
-   Each directory contains an ordered set of JavaScript files that represent steps in the challenge.
-   Step files are named sequentially and should be run in order (e.g., `01_instructions.js`, `02_action.js`).
-   The last step file in each challenge will end with a congratulatory message upon successful completion.

## Workflow

1. Read the first step file for instructions.
2. Complete the tasks as directed.
3. Run subsequent step files to check your work and receive further instructions.
4. The cleanup script can be run to remove all `output.txt`, `output.js`, and `output/` directories before starting a new challenge.
